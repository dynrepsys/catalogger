# Catalogger
Catalogger is a data organization tool and interface for large volumes of archives.

Primary design objectives:
1. Enable post-hoc metadata to be added and tracked for any file in any archive on any volume forever
1. Enable browsing/searching/filtering based on file metadata, and content within reason
1. Maintain backwards compatibility with old volumes even as metadata tracking mechanisms evolve

Secondary objectives:
1. Avoid duplicate storage of the same file, or enable recovering space used by duplicates
1. Support automatic generation of thumbnails for images, video files, docs, pdf's and other suitable file types
1. Maintain tracking of content as files are transformed across volumes, ie compressed or re-encoded
